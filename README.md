In this module we are Extracting ,Transforming and Loading the data using Jupyrter Notebook,Postgresql</br/>
Data extracted from wikimovies , kaggle are used as inputs ,output data stored in postgresql as two tables </br>
The input file ratings.csv has 26x10^6 data entries if you open it in excel you can see only 14X10^6 since excel can hold only that much data</br>
Make sure to check the size of the file after downloading and storing which can prevent mistakes .
